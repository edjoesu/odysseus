Overview
========

Odysseus was started to have a complete, well-documented program to fit images of ultra-cold atom clouds. It has grown over time, so it now includes a graphical user interface that enables live image viewing and data analysis while running an experiment.

Odysseus is written in `Python <http://python.org>`_ and makes use of the `Numpy <http://scipy.org/NumPy>`_, `Scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_ and `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ packages. Most of the functionality is for fermionic atoms.
